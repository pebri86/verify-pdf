## Installation of docker engine
This manual uses Docker on Ubuntu Linux Operating System. For other Linux distributions or operating systems, refer to the official Docker installation documentation at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Uninstall old version (if any)
Older versions of Docker were known as docker, docker.io, or docker-engine, and you might also have installations of containerd or runc. Uninstall any such older versions before attempting to install a new version:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```

### Install using the apt repository
Before installing Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

#### Set up the repository
1. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

 ```bash
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg
 ```
2. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

 ```bash
 $ sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
 $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg \
    --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
 $ sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
 ```
3. Use the following command to set up the repository:

 ```bash
 $ echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings /docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
 ```
 
#### Install Docker Engine

1. Update the apt package index:

 ```bash
 $ sudo apt-get update
 ```
2. Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.
 
 To install the latest version, run:
 ```bash
 $ sudo apt-get install \
    docker-ce docker-ce-cli \
    containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin \
    docker-compose-plugin
 ```

3. Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:

 ```bash
 $ sudo docker run hello-world
 ```
 
## Installing the Signing Adapter Docker Image

### Prerequisites

1. Create directories for document storage

 ```bash
 $ sudo mkdir -p /root/logs
 $ sudo mkdir -p /root/sharefolder
 $ sudo mkdir -p /root/sharefolder/SIGNED 
 $ sudo mkdir -p /root/sharefolder/UNSIGNED 
 $ sudo mkdir -p /root/sharefolder/SPECIMEN
 ```
 ** Note: On production, these directories may be located in NFS storage or similar.
 
2. Create a directory for the project file on your home directory and change directory to the created directory

 ```bash
 $ cd $HOME
 $ mkdir -p signadapter
 $ cd signadapter
 ```
 
3. Create a docker-compose.yml configuration file to run the container using docker-compose

 ```bash
 $ touch docker-compose.yml
 ```
 edit using your favorite text editor

 ```bash
 $ nano docker-compose.yml
 ```
 write this configuration and save the file

 ```yaml
 version: '3.1'
    services:
        adapter:
            container_name: perisai-adapter
            image: registry.perurica.co.id:443/keysign/signadapter:latest
            restart: always
            privileged: true
            ports: 
            - "9044:7777"
            environment:
                HASH_URL: https://apgdev.peruri.co.id:9044/gateway/digitalCertificateHashSign/1.0/signingHash/v1
                CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_URL: https://apgdev.peruri.co.id:9044/gateway/digitalCertificateHashSign/1.0/getCertificateChain/v1
                TSA_URL: http://timestamp.peruri.co.id/signserver/tsa?workerName=TimeStampSigner1101
                TZ: Asia/Jakarta
                UNSIGNED_FOLDER: /sharefolder/UNSIGNED
                SIGNED_FOLDER: /sharefolder/SIGNED
                SPC_FOLDER: /sharefolder/SPECIMEN
                KEYSTORE: /certs
                WORKER: 4
                TIMEOUT: 240
                GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT: 320
                KEEP_ALIVE: 30
            volumes:
                - /root/logs:/logs
                - /root/sharefolder:/sharefolder
 ```
4. To run the Docker container:

 Start the Docker container by running the following command with sudo:

 ```bash
 $ sudo docker compose up -d
 ```

 To verify that the container is running, use the following command:

 ```bash
 $ sudo docker ps
 ```

 The output should be similar to this:

 ```bash
 CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                      COMMAND                CREATED        STATUS                       PORTS                              NAMES
8ba281c25a23   registry.perurica.co.id:443/keysign/signadapter:latest     "/bin/app"             3 hours ago    Up About an hour             0.0.0.0:9044->7777/tcp             perisai-adapter
 ```
